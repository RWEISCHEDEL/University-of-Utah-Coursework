# Similar to "show_pid.whoosh", but uses the PID to
# terminate a sleeping process

/bin/sleep 2 @ $sleep | /bin/kill -TSTP $sleep

/bin/echo resume
/bin/kill -CONT $sleep

/bin/echo wait
# Should wait about 2 more seconds before finishing

# Expected output:
#  resume
#  wait

# Minimum seconds:
#  2
