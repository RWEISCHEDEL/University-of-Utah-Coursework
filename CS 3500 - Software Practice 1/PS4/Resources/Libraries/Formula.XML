            <summary>
            Represents formulas written in standard infix notation using standard precedence
            rules.  The allowed symbols are non-negative numbers written using double-precision 
            floating-point syntax; variables that consist of a letter or underscore followed by 
            zero or more letters, underscores, or digits; parentheses; and the four operator 
            symbols +, -, *, and /.  
            
            Spaces are significant only insofar that they delimit tokens.  For example, "xy" is
            a single variable, "x y" consists of two variables "x" and y; "x23" is a single variable; 
            and "x 23" consists of a variable "x" and a number "23".
            
            Associated with every formula are two delegates:  a normalizer and a validator.  The
            normalizer is used to convert variables into a canonical form, and the validator is used
            to add extra restrictions on the validity of a variable (beyond the standard requirement 
            that it consist of a letter or underscore followed by zero or more letters, underscores,
            or digits.)  Their use is described in detail in the constructor and method comments.

            <summary>
            Creates a Formula from a string that consists of an infix expression written as
            described in the class comment.  If the expression is syntactically invalid,
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory Message.
            
            The associated normalizer is the identity function, and the associated validator
            maps every string to true.

            <summary>
            Creates a Formula from a string that consists of an infix expression written as
            described in the class comment.  If the expression is syntactically incorrect,
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory Message.
            
            The associated normalizer and validator are the second and third parameters,
            respectively.  
            
            If the formula contains a variable v such that normalize(v) is not a legal variable, 
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory message. 
            
            If the formula contains a variable v such that isValid(normalize(v)) is false,
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory message.
            
            Suppose that N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case, and
            that V is a method that returns true only if a string consists of one letter followed
            by one digit.  Then:
            
            new Formula("x2+y3", N, V) should succeed
            new Formula("x+y3", N, V) should throw an exception, since V(N("x")) is false
            new Formula("2x+y3", N, V) should throw an exception, since "2x+y3" is syntactically incorrect.

        <member name="M:SpreadsheetUtilities.Formula.Evaluate(System.Func{System.String,System.Double})">
             <summary>
             Evaluates this Formula, using the lookup delegate to determine the values of
             variables.  When a variable symbol v needs to be determined, it should be looked up
             via lookup(normalize(v)). (Here, normalize is the normalizer that was passed to 
             the constructor.)
             
             For example, if L("x") is 2, L("X") is 4, and N is a method that converts all the letters 
             in a string to upper case:
             
             new Formula("x+7", N, s => true).Evaluate(L) is 11
             new Formula("x+7").Evaluate(L) is 9
             
             Given a variable symbol as its parameter, lookup returns the variable's value 
             (if it has one) or throws an ArgumentException (otherwise).
             
             If no undefined variables or divisions by zero are encountered when evaluating 
             this Formula, the value is returned.  Otherwise, a FormulaError is returned.  
             The Reason property of the FormulaError should have a meaningful explanation.
            
             This method should never throw an exception.

        <member name="M:SpreadsheetUtilities.Formula.GetVariables">
            <summary>
            Enumerates the normalized versions of all of the variables that occur in this 
            formula.  No normalization may appear more than once in the enumeration, even 
            if it appears more than once in this Formula.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
            
            new Formula("x+y*z", N, s => true).GetVariables() should enumerate "X", "Y", and "Z"
            new Formula("x+X*z", N, s => true).GetVariables() should enumerate "X" and "Z".
            new Formula("x+X*z").GetVariables() should enumerate "x", "X", and "z".

        <member name="M:SpreadsheetUtilities.Formula.ToString">
            <summary>
            Returns a string containing no spaces which, if passed to the Formula
            constructor, will produce a Formula f such that this.Equals(f).  All of the
            variables in the string should be normalized.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
            
            new Formula("x + y", N, s => true).ToString() should return "X+Y"

            If obj is null or obj is not a Formula, returns false.  Otherwise, reports
            whether or not this Formula and obj are equal.
            
            Two Formulae are considered equal if they consist of the same tokens in the
            same order.  To determine token equality, all tokens are compared as strings 
            except for numeric tokens, which are compared as doubles, and variable tokens,
            whose normalized forms are compared as strings.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
             
            new Formula("x1+y2", N, s => true).Equals(new Formula("X1  +  Y2")) is true
            new Formula("x1+y2").Equals(new Formula("X1+Y2")) is false
            new Formula("x1+y2").Equals(new Formula("y2+x1")) is false
            new Formula("2.0 + x7").Equals(new Formula("2.000 + x7")) is true

            Reports whether f1 == f2, using the notion of equality from the Equals method.
            Note that if both f1 and f2 are null, this method should return true.  If one is
            null and one is not, this method should return false.

            Note that if both f1 and f2 are null, this method should return false.  If one is
            null and one is not, this method should return true.

            <summary>
            Returns a hash code for this Formula.  If f1.Equals(f2), then it must be the
            case that f1.GetHashCode() == f2.GetHashCode().  Ideally, the probability that two 
            randomly-generated unequal Formulae have the same hash code should be extremely small.

            <summary>
            Given an expression, enumerates the tokens that compose it.  Tokens are left paren;
            right paren; one of the four operator symbols; a string consisting of a letter or underscore
            followed by zero or more letters, digits, or underscores; a double literal; and anything that doesn't
            match one of those patterns.  There are no empty tokens, and no token contains white space.

            <summary>
            This method serves as a validator to ensure that the variables that are typed into the formula expression are valid. A variable can start with 
            a underscore and anycase letter. It can end with a underscore, a number, and anycase letter.

            <summary>
            This method serves as a helper method for the Evaluate function. It looks at the top of the operator stack and sees if two different symbols are or are not on top of the stack.
            It also checks to see if the stack has at least one value as well, if not it returns false.
