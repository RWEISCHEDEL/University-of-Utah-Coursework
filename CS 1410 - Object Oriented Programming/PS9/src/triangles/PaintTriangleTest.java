/**
 * This is the PaintTriangle JUnit Set of Test cases. Since the Graphics object is passed through all the methods
 * or information is passed from the ActionListener in Sierpinski directly into the PaintTriangle, I was unable to
 * make a set of test cases for the PaintTriangle class. Although I thought it would be good to just create this 
 * set of cases to explain the situation to the person who is grading my assingment. The test cases weten't required 
 * in PS9 if the graphics onject was passed those certain methods.
