	Extra Extensions:
	
	Random ship teleport, press T and the ship will teleport to a random location on the screen. But
	be warned, you run the risk of teleporting into an asteroid.
	
	Notice if you are playing the game there will be a small heart shaped piece that will appear on screen.
	If you collide the ship with this piece you will gain and extra life, you cannot shoot the heart you must
	drive into it. However, if an asteroid hits the heart piece before you reach it it will be destroyed.
	
	Note:
	We had some lag issues when we ran our Program with older versions of Java on the Windows Lab computers.
	So if this occurs, we will be more than happy to show you our program on a different system to show 
	that the game works properly and efficiently with newer Java versions.
