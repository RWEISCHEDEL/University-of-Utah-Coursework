    /*
     * Predefined Constants (static member variables):
     *
     *   int MAXDATASIZE : the maximum size of the Message data and
     *                     Packet payload
     *
     *   int A           : a predefined integer that represents entity A
     *   int B           : a predefined integer that represents entity B
     *
     *
     * Predefined Member Methods:
     *
     *  void stopTimer(int entity): 
     *       Stops the timer running at "entity" [A or B]
     *  void startTimer(int entity, double increment): 
     *       Starts a timer running at "entity" [A or B], which will expire in
     *       "increment" time units, causing the interrupt handler to be
     *       called.  You should only call this with A.
     *  void toLayer3(int callingEntity, Packet p)
     *       Puts the packet "p" into the network from "callingEntity" [A or B]
     *  void toLayer5(int entity, String dataSent)
     *       Passes "dataSent" up to layer 5 from "entity" [A or B]
     *  double getTime()
     *       Returns the current time in the simulator.  Might be useful for
     *       debugging.
     *  void printEventList()
     *       Prints the current event list to stdout.  Might be useful for
     *       debugging, but probably not.

     *  Predefined Classes:
     *
     *  Message: Used to encapsulate a message coming from layer 5
     *    Constructor:
     *      Message(String inputData): 
     *          creates a new Message containing "inputData"
     *    Methods:
     *      boolean setData(String inputData):
     *          sets an existing Message's data to "inputData"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      String getData():
     *          returns the data contained in the message
     *  Packet: Used to encapsulate a packet
     *    Constructors:
     *      Packet (Packet p):
     *          creates a new Packet that is a copy of "p"
     *      Packet (int seq, int ack, int check, String newPayload)
     *          creates a new Packet with a sequence field of "seq", an
     *          ack field of "ack", a checksum field of "check", and a
     *          payload of "newPayload"
     *      Packet (int seq, int ack, int check)
     *          chreate a new Packet with a sequence field of "seq", an
     *          ack field of "ack", a checksum field of "check", and
     *          an empty payload
     *    Methods:
     *      boolean setSeqnum(int n)
     *          sets the Packet's sequence field to "n"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      boolean setAcknum(int n)
     *          sets the Packet's ack field to "n"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      boolean setChecksum(int n)
     *          sets the Packet's checksum to "n"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      boolean setPayload(String newPayload)
     *          sets the Packet's payload to "newPayload"
     *          returns true on success, false otherwise
     *      int getSeqnum()
     *          returns the contents of the Packet's sequence field
     *      int getAcknum()
     *          returns the contents of the Packet's ack field
     *      int getChecksum()
     *          returns the checksum of the Packet
     *      int getPayload()
     *          returns the Packet's payload
