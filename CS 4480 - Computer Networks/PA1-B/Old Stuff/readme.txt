NewClientConnection.java - Is a class that assists the accepting and handling of clients.
ProxyServer.java - Contains main method to start server.
pa1.jar


How to Complie and Run:

First way to run proxy - 
In the commandline type : "java -jar .jar <port#>"

Then telnet into the localhost on the previously entered port number and then type away your commands!

Second way to run proxy -
Set your browers network connection HTTP proxy to be my proxys port number. 

And enter web addresses in the brower as you normally would.



About the Proxy:
The proxy currently works on both command line and the web browser. But it will only work on the web 
browser if all the correct information browser setup info has been typed in. Like suggested in the 
assignment specifications for testing.

Source Code:
The code has been cleaned up and comments have been added. But it still does have some print line statements
that I choose to leave in to aid in further testing and development.
