Readme - HW1

How To Run:
To run my project simply run the ./run.sh command.

Notes:
I believe that my algorithms work just fine, but I do get lower accuracy values. I did come up
with several of my own, so maybe I chose poor features. My accuracy range is typically in the 60%
range. Also this is the second submission of the assignment, due to the run.sh not working for some
reason.
