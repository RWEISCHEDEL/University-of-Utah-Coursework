Homework 1
You can run my homework by simply running the maim.m file. It should be noted that you will receive no output, until the program has finished running. Or in other words
that you will not see the output images (I have chosen to display them using figures...) until the program finishes. For all figures I place them in this order: the
right most image is the output image, while the others are the input image(s). All reading the images is done within the specfic problem .m function. All .m files only contain
1 function, plus some reading and saving image handling.

Time to Run the Program
Problem 1 : Canny Edge Detection - About 1m 30s Per Image, so about 4m 30s in total.
Problem 2 : Simple Sky Segmentaion - About 2/3s for the entire program.
Problem 3: Setero Matching - About 20s Each for the two smaller images, and about 2m 30s for the larger image, so about 3m 30s in total.
